# PRPCOW
### Plain Remote Procedure Call Over Websocket
#### What is the PRPCOW?
PRPCOW is a new kind of RPC, that takes advantage of the advancement in `WebSocket` technology, and the power of `Node.js`.
### Why use PRPCOW?
> Supports Node.js (`>=16.x`) as well as all modern browsers

> Allows you to use functions natively like `await someFunc()`

> After connecting, the server and the client become equal (the client can provide functions for execution)

> Ability to create your own `modelResolvers` and `functionResolvers`

> Ability to use your own Websocket implementation
